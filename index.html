    <h1>
        Information about me!
    </h1>

    <p class="bold">Hi, I'm Areeb Syed and this website is about my life.</p>

    <p class="underline">
        I am a sophmore at Bergen County Acadamies in
        AAST, and I really enjoy my life
    </p>
    <p class="xedout"> aside from my grades. </p>

    <p>
        If you were to ask me my favortie color I would respond "purple", however, yellow and green are close seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some of my favorite places I've been to include: Belgium for it's amazing milkshakes and hazelnut praline
        waffles,
        Copenhaegen for its nice cityscape and cool weather, and Canada for that breath of nature and beautiful sights.
    </p
    Something else that I think is distinct about me is the way I hold my pencil
    <em> with my thumb on the bottom and my pointer and middle fingers on top.</em>
    Lastly, I think Fruits are way better than vegetables, and mango is the #1 fruit, banana is easily
    second!
    </p>
