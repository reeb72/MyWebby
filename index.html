    <h1>
        Information about me!
    </h1>

    <p class="bold">Hello, my name is Areeb, and this webpage is about me.</p>

    <p>
        Right now, I'm a sophmore in
        <span class="underline"> BCA's AAST,</span>
        and I'm pretty happy
        <span class="xedout"> aside from my grades.</span>
    </p>



    <p>
        My favorite color is purple
        <span class="em"> which you could probably tell from the background color</span>
        but I also like the colors green and yellow.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've been to many places, especially in Europe! My favorite locations include
        Brussels, Belgium because of the
        <span class="every">amazing ‎</span>
        milkshakes; waffles with hazelnut praline; and warm weather;
        Copenhagen, Denmark for the beautiful city feel; cool weather; and nice people;
        and finally Toronto, Canada which has great clothing choices; exhilirating scenery such as Niagra Falls;
        and the lovely breath of nature as a whole!
    </p>
    <p>Something else that I think is distinct about me is the way I hold my pencil
        <span class="em"> with my thumb on the bottom and my pointer and middle fingers on top.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="bold"> Fruits >>> vegetables</span>

        <br>

        Fruits just have that juciness and sweetness that makes them so delicious,
        mangoes reign supreme for besst tasting fruit wheras bananas are easily the runner up.
    </p>

    <p>
        I REALLY LIKE DOLPHINS THEY ARE COOL!!

        This is my second favorite picture of me in
        8<sup>th</sup>
        grade. Despite COVID-19, I still had a lot of fun and was at my best that year.
