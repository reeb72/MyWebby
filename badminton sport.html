        My favorite, and the most underated sport, Badminton
    </h1>

    <br>

    <p>
        Badminton was introduced to me early on as a child, and is a fun sport that is not talked about enough.
        Despite not being big into sports, I found myself having a lot of fun whenever I would play
        badminton with my father, especially due to the fast paced nature of the game.
        I understand that some people think it may be boring to watch, but when you acctually play it, you have so much
        fun.
        However, this sport doesn't get enough recognition, possibly for it's simplicity.
        This page

        cointains the rules for the sport so if you consider playing it and have the materials: A really big net,
        Two or more badminton rackets, and a shuttlecock. If you have those then you can play the game! 
        I prefer to play outside because of the natural breathtaking experience. However,
        profesionals play it inside because they don't want the weather to interfere with the gameplay. One more little detail, I believe that
        Badminton orignated a European sport
        but it was quickly adopted by many of all of Asia including but not limited to: China, India, Japan, Malaysia,
        South Korea, Pakistan, etc.
