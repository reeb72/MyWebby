        My favorite, and the most underated sport, Badminton 
    </h1>

    <br>

    <p>
        Badminton was introduced to me early on as a child, and is a fun sport that is not talked about enough.
        Despite not being big into sports, I found myself having a lot of fun whenever I would play
        badminton with my father, especially due to the fast paced nature of the game.
        I understand that some people think it may be boring to watch, but when you acctually play it, you have so much
        <strong>fun.</strong>
        However, this sport doesn't get enough recognition, possibly for it's simplicity.
        This page</a>
        cointains the rules for the sport so if you consider playing it and have the materials:
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <em>really</em> big net
        </li>

        <li>
            Two plus badminton rackets
        </li>

        <li>
            A shuttlecock
        </li>
    </ul>

    Then you can play the game! I prefer to play outside because of the natural breathtaking experience. However,
    profesionals play it inside
    because they don't want the weather to interfere with the gameplay. One more little detail, I believe that Badminton
    orignated a European sport
    but it was quickly adopted by many of all of Asia including but not limited to: China, India, Japan, Malaysia, South
    Korea, Pakistan, etc.
